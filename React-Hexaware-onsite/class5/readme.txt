# Props and State

Prop -> properties -> send data between the components
State -> data -> it is data maintain within a compnent

# Props vs state
1. props are passed to the component where as state is managed with in a compnent
2. props are immutable where as state can be changed
3. in functional componenmt we can pass props as a function parameter where as we declare variable within a 
   function for state
